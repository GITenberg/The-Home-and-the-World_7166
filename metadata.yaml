description: "The Home and the World (in the original Bengali, ঘরে বাইরে Ghôre Baire,\
  \ lit. \"At home and outside\") is a 1916 novel by Rabindranath Tagore. The book\
  \ illustrates the battle Tagore had with himself, between the ideas of Western culture\
  \ and revolution against the Western culture. These two ideas are portrayed in two\
  \ of the main characters, Nikhil, who is rational and opposes violence, and Sandip,\
  \ who will let nothing stand in his way from reaching his goals. These two opposing\
  \ ideals are very important in understanding the history of the Bengali region and\
  \ its contemporary problems. There is much controversy over whether or not Tagore\
  \ was attempting to represent Gandhi with Sandip. Many argue that Tagore would not\
  \ even venture to personify Gandhi in his characters because Tagore was a large\
  \ admirer of Gandhi. Also, Gandhi was against violence, while Sandip would utilize\
  \ violence to get what he wanted. The book shows \"the clash between new and old,\
  \ realism and idealism, the means and the end, good and evil\" (p xxiv) within India\
  \ and southern Asia.\nThe novel was translated into English by the author's nephew,\
  \ Surendranath Tagore, with input from the author, in 1919.\n From Wikipedia (CC\
